## Welcome YO

The Swaps API test test provides instant cross-chain swap and bridge functionality for decentralized applications. It supports multiple virtual machines (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin) and various DEX protocols and bridge solutions.

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For this documentation, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "ApiKeyAuth": []
  }
]
```

## Base URL

The API is available at the following base URLs:

- **Production**: `https://api.decent.xyz`
- **Development**: `http://localhost:4000`

## Getting Started

To use the Swaps API, you'll need:

1. An API key for authentication
2. The sender's address
3. Source and destination chain IDs
4. Action configuration for your specific use case

The API supports three main action types:
- **swap-action**: For token swaps
- **evm-function**: For calling EVM contract functions
- **evm-calldata-tx**: For custom EVM transactions
